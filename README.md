# Hi, I'm Mahdi Rahmani Zadeh

I am a fourth-year Physics student at the University of Tabriz with a deep interest in **quantum computing** and its transformative potential. My academic journey is driven by curiosity in quantum technologies, particularly in the development of algorithms, error mitigation strategies, and quantum control techniques.

## My Quantum Computing Journey

- Completed the [Qiskit Global Summer School 2024](https://www.credly.com/users/mehdi-rahmani-zadeh), focusing on a variety of advanced quantum topics.
- Earned several [IBM Quantum Computing badges](https://www.credly.com/users/mehdi-rahmani-zadeh), including:
  - **Basics of Quantum Information**
  - **Variational Algorithm Design**
  - **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**
  - **Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 - Quantum Excellence**

## Quantum Computing Projects

### 1. **Bachelor’s Projects**

- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**  
  My Bachelor's project, supervised by Dr. Mahdian, focused on designing and implementing the VQE algorithm. I worked extensively on **ansatz design**, **parameter optimization**, and **error mitigation techniques** to efficiently compute ground state energies for molecular systems. This project helped me understand the practical challenges and potential of variational algorithms in near-term quantum computers.

- **Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and Fault-Tolerant Gates**  
  Under the supervision of Dr. Soufiani, I explored the **fundamentals of quantum error correction** (QEC) and **fault-tolerant quantum computation**. I focused on studying stabilizer codes, logical qubit encoding, and fault-tolerant gate implementations, essential for stabilizing quantum systems and preventing errors in quantum algorithms.

### 2. **Current Project: Optimal Control for Qubit Gates using GRAPE and CRAB**

I am currently working on optimizing quantum gate fidelities through **Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE)** and **Chopped Random Basis (CRAB)** algorithms. The research involves:
- Simulating pulse sequences for superconducting qubits using QuTiP and Qiskit Pulse.
- Developing pulse shaping techniques to minimize gate errors and enhance coherence times.
- Investigating applications in **variational quantum algorithms** and **quantum error mitigation** by reducing the impact of decoherence and control noise.

### 3. **Qiskit Global Summer School 2024**

At the **Qiskit Global Summer School**, I gained in-depth knowledge in the following topics:
- Qiskit workflow and **Qiskit Runtime Primitives**
- **Quantum Circuit Compilation**
- **Hardware Noise Modeling and Characterization**
- **Execution on Noisy Quantum Hardware**: Strategies for fighting errors before fault tolerance
- **Workflows for Quantum-Centric Supercomputing**
- **Mapping Computational Problems onto Quantum Circuits**
- **Quantum Combinatorial Optimization**
- **Hamiltonian Dynamics**: Applications and simulation
- **Quantum Machine Learning**

### 4. **Feature Proposals**

- Proposed a **compatibility-based backend selection** feature for Qiskit to improve quantum circuit fidelity by aligning circuits with backend-specific gate requirements and connectivity. This feature aims to optimize the performance of quantum circuits by selecting the most appropriate hardware configuration. [Proposal Link](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/2016)
