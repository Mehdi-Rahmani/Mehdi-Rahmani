# Hi, I'm Mehdi Rahmani Zadeh

As a fourth year student studying physics at University of Tabriz, I have an interest in quantum computing and its applications in the world, which has been a driving force in my academic journey so far. 

## My Progress so far

- Completed the [Qiskit Global Summer School 2024](https://www.credly.com/users/mehdi-rahmani-zadeh)


- Earned several [IBM Quantum Computing related badges](https://www.credly.com/users/mehdi-rahmani-zadeh)
    - Basics of Quantum Information
    - Variational Algorithm Design
    - Practical Introduction to Quantum-Safe Cryptography
    - Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 - Quantum Excellence
## Quantum Computing Projects
### 1. Bachelor's Projects

- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**  
  Project on designing and implementing VQE, including ansatz design, parameter optimization, and error mitigation techniques.

- **Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and Fault-Tolerant Gates**  
  Explored the fundamentals of quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

### 2. Qiskit Global Summer School
I completed Qiskit's Global Summer School 2024, where I learned About the following topics:
- Introduction to Qiskit workflow, and Qiskit Runtime Primitives
- Quantum Circuit Compilation
- Hardware Noise modeling and Characterization
- Execution on Noisy Quantum Hardware: fighting errors before fault tolerance
- Workflows for Quantum-Centric Supercomputing
- Mapping Computational Problems onto Quantum Circuits
- Quantum Combinatorial Optimization
- Hamiltonian Dynamics: Applications and Simulation
- Quantum Machine Learning

### 3. Feature Proposals
- Proposed a feature for compatibility-based backend selection in Qiskit to optimize circuit fidelity by aligning quantum circuits with backend-specific gate requirements and connectivity. [https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/issues/2016]
