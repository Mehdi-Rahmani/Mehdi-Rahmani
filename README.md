# Hi, I'm Mehdi Rahmani Zadeh

I’m currently in my 4th year of a physics bachelor's program, with a strong focus on quantum computing. My academic and research interests lie in understanding the deep potential of quantum algorithms and their real-world applications. 

I've completed projects in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) and Quantum Error Correction, and I've had the privilege of participating in Qiskit's Global Summer School 2024. I am passionate about exploring the frontiers of quantum computing and applying my skills to solve complex problems in this field. I am actively seeking opportunities for further academic development, particularly in quantum information science, and my dream is to pursue a career where I can contribute to cutting-edge research.
