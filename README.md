# Hi, I'm Mehdi Rahmani Zadeh

As a fourth year student studying physics I have an interest, in quantum computing and its applications in the world, which has been a driving force, in my academic journey so far. 

During my journey far I've been involved in projects related to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) and Quantum Error Correction. Attending Qiskits Global Summer School in 2024 was a highlight for me, as it fueled my passion for this area more. I'm excited about delving into quantum information science and aspiring to build a career where I can make contributions, to cutting edge research.
